Q1. This is a revision video, after watching which you will
Physics revision will be tough so let's go
If you keep the money then she is saying that you are mummy's
you don't pay attention and I taught you
I can do anything so hello everybody
Welcome to my channel so how are you all
So in the ultra revision video you ______
Welcome to the full one hour approx
We have to revise the entire physics of
There are going to be a lot of problems before the exams
Chapter 1 to 14 will be important
To revise, read further in the video
Subscribe before it reaches 1 Lakh
We have a target towards subscribers
Guys please complete it for you
I'm working so hard, you just do this much
Dude please go now and subscribe
And share it with your friends as much as you can
It is possible to watch this video in addition to all these
In the coming time you will join a batch of CU
I am going to bring for the people the CET
gonna stay for physics because you
You know that you give the boards but college
If you want to go then you will have to give CVT exam
And you will have to study physics again there.
   1. people
   2. field
   3. much
   4. guys
   [Answer: guys]

Q2. I get to see you guys at rest
There are two types of charges here
People get to see positive
Negative and their nature is totally different
If you guys dislike the charges together
If you want then try to attract each other
When you guys try to like charges
If you bring them closer they repel each other
we do that which is alike meaning that it is of the same type
And unlike means those who are of different types
Apart from all this, there are no charges for anything else
has properties such as quantization meaning
that the charges are always integral multiples of
Remain present in fundamental charges only
and there is a specific formula for this
which is made here is equal to plus
minus of n if the distance from one body to another
If charges are getting transferred in the body then this
You can find out the ______ using the formula
You can accept that it is important besides this
that there are too many charges inside the system
present you need to find out how many
If net charges are present then you people
You will have to make it addictive, does that mean you care about everyone
People can add on whatever the charges may be
Plus them and your ______ will be calculated
I will go and tell you all
I want the charges now there is single charge
So okay but the second charge is very close
If it comes, then both the charges are placed on each other
and start trying to explain that floor
Kalms did the work, this is what Kalms said
that when there are big charges then there will be big
It seems like small charges
Small furs and the actual furs
These are inversely proportional on distance too
The further away you are the lesser the charges
The closer the force is, the more force
So, through Colombian law, we have two charges.
   1. form
   2. value
   3. guys
   4. people
   [Answer: value]

Q3. which will remain in the form of MC then you people
I am going to start it from the first of April
I am going to give you all the details of this course
it is in the description and very soon this
There is a dedicated video for you guys on the channel too
I will tell you about the whistle and many more
After youtube's I dedicated it to you guys
Let me explain to you how to prepare
So let's start for CBT
Let's start preparing for the boards
First of all, let us complete it
our chapter number one is called
Electric charges and ______s as you
Do you know the charges in this chapter?
   1. people
   2. form
   3. field
   4. value
   [Answer: field]

Q4. So in one you have positive charge density
I took both in the other negatively
If we take the distance between them as d then it becomes
Your parallel capacitor is gone, someone asked you
One may ask, what is the difference between a parallel plate capacitor and a
When there is no medium of any kind in between
means there was air in between so at that time
Method to check the value of capacitance
If she used to get it then she used to get it n a / d if someone
This means that between parallel plate capacitors
If dielectric material is taken into account then
Difference will be seen in capacitance
Obviously something will be seen and it will come
The value k n a / d is what happens many times na
Parallel plate capacitors have some distance in between
If the dielectric was brought into place
Numerical problems cannot be solved at that time
If you find it, there is a special formula for it
it happens it happens a / d - t + t / k
Or if we assume the capacitor to be
connect it in series in a proper way at that time
what will be the capacitance then remember that
The capacitance at time 1 is given by
/ c which is equal to 1 / c1 + 1 / c2
In addition to the number of capacitors you use, if you
People have connected capacitors in parallel form
If you have applied it then remember the parallel form
What is the value of capacitance in
whatever capacitance comes from c1 + c2
put the value of its capacitance PSC
told you that its not a derivation
its numerical will come what does it mean
How much energy is stored inside a capacitor
If yes, then she remains in the form of half poet
half q s / c in the form of half cv1
in the form which you will get in the examination
The values ​​given in the question are
Accordingly you can choose the formula and get the answer
Find out the next topic of yours
Remember the name is ______ electricity
Those of you inside chapter one chapter two
There were charges, those were on rest, now the charges
I started running whenever the charges came on time
When you run, ______ is produced and
Current is always q/t, always remember this
If you get electric shock from any conductor
If you run, you know that the electron
drift in the opposite end direction
If one starts doing it then the drift that occurs at that time
while doing this the velocity with which the electron travels
When we travel, that is called drift
velocity drift velocity you guys three
There is an electric scooter in different forms
In the field form it is l e e ta /
m is in the form of potential difference
ta /
ml8 is it you know in Holmes law you guys
you might have read it v chach is equal to aa hota hai
r What is resistance?
   1. comes
   2. current
   3. form
   4. much
   [Answer: current]

Q5. it happens force upon charge or i can say
am 1/4 pa n q/r of square here
Always ______ its unit is Newton per Coulomb
you guys are going to get to see and
Always ______ that every charge is around you
What a field produces is
If the charge depends on whom
If there is positive charge then it is on the outside
Electric field will be seen as negative
If it is there then you will get to see it inside
Electric field inside and outside is a rail form
I get to see you guys, I miss you guys
is the value of k in Coulomb's law, and here
You guys need to know about K in electric field.
   1. remember
   2. current
   3. people
   4. value
   [Answer: remember]

Q6. I get to see you guys at rest

Q8. This is asked many times, you people should know
must remember the wheat stone bridge when balancing
If it remains in condition then on the middle portion
No current can see you running
means only current is received in this portion
after this the next one runs in
The topic comes up that is moving charges and
Remember magnetism first and second
Your story was different in the third chapter
Now if the charge was moving then current would be produced
I was doing it perpendicular to the current
Magnetic field produced in the direction
this is why the name of the chapter is that
A ______ field is created due to the moving charge.
   1. current
   2. comes
   3. remember
   4. magnetic
   [Answer: magnetic]
