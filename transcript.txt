This is a revision video, after watching which you will
Physics revision will be tough so let's go
If you keep the money then she is saying that you are mummy's
you don't pay attention and I taught you
I can do anything so hello everybody
Welcome to my channel so how are you all
So in the ultra revision video you guys
Welcome to the full one hour approx
We have to revise the entire physics of
There are going to be a lot of problems before the exams
Chapter 1 to 14 will be important
To revise, read further in the video
Subscribe before it reaches 1 Lakh
We have a target towards subscribers
Guys please complete it for you
I'm working so hard, you just do this much
Dude please go now and subscribe
And share it with your friends as much as you can
It is possible to watch this video in addition to all these
In the coming time you will join a batch of CU
I am going to bring for the people the CET
gonna stay for physics because you
You know that you give the boards but college
If you want to go then you will have to give CVT exam
And you will have to study physics again there.
which will remain in the form of MC then you people
I am going to start it from the first of April
I am going to give you all the details of this course
it is in the description and very soon this
There is a dedicated video for you guys on the channel too
I will tell you about the whistle and many more
After youtube's I dedicated it to you guys
Let me explain to you how to prepare
So let's start for CBT
Let's start preparing for the boards
First of all, let us complete it
our chapter number one is called
Electric charges and fields as you
Do you know the charges in this chapter?
I get to see you guys at rest
There are two types of charges here
People get to see positive
Negative and their nature is totally different
If you guys dislike the charges together
If you want then try to attract each other
When you guys try to like charges
If you bring them closer they repel each other
we do that which is alike meaning that it is of the same type
And unlike means those who are of different types
Apart from all this, there are no charges for anything else
has properties such as quantization meaning
that the charges are always integral multiples of
Remain present in fundamental charges only
and there is a specific formula for this
which is made here is equal to plus
minus of n if the distance from one body to another
If charges are getting transferred in the body then this
You can find out the value using the formula
You can accept that it is important besides this
that there are too many charges inside the system
present you need to find out how many
If net charges are present then you people
You will have to make it addictive, does that mean you care about everyone
People can add on whatever the charges may be
Plus them and your value will be calculated
I will go and tell you all
I want the charges now there is single charge
So okay but the second charge is very close
If it comes, then both the charges are placed on each other
and start trying to explain that floor
Kalms did the work, this is what Kalms said
that when there are big charges then there will be big
It seems like small charges
Small furs and the actual furs
These are inversely proportional on distance too
The further away you are the lesser the charges
The closer the force is, the more force
So, through Colombian law, we have two charges.
we can understand the force of interaction between
and that force is k q1 q2 / r
We will call this square in vector form.
You can write it in this way, this is force
So it is obvious that you people in Newton
unit will be seen now let's assume that
If there are a lot of charges you guys need a system
The reasons for all this can be seen inside
How much did you guys get from net farce
So that can be removed with the help of super position
You can pay as many charges as you want individually
You are forcing the value of all of them
Sum the vectors and find out their value
Now there is a single charge, so every charge will be
It produces a field around
What is the intensity of the field?
it happens force upon charge or i can say
am 1/4 pa n q/r of square here
Always remember its unit is Newton per Coulomb
you guys are going to get to see and
Always remember that every charge is around you
What a field produces is
If the charge depends on whom
If there is positive charge then it is on the outside
Electric field will be seen as negative
If it is there then you will get to see it inside
Electric field inside and outside is a rail form
I get to see you guys, I miss you guys
is the value of k in Coulomb's law, and here
You guys need to know about K in electric field.
The value is shown here which is the value of k
this is 1/4 pa an here Alan comes Alan
What is Permit Permitting in Actual form
Affects the interaction between two charges
If permitting becomes more then it is forced off
Interaction will decrease, permitting will decrease
then the force of interaction will become greater and
Remember, after this comes another relative
What does permitting mean for a medium
How many times more than the permitting air
It is different, what is there and what is not
It is the job of relative permitting to explain it to him
remember the formula after this
keep it, assume that you guys have different
take a body take a linear body take a
I took the surface body and you guys took one
What type of body do you have? What kind of volume do you have?
Now you guys have put charges in all this
Continuously distributed distributor above it
Does that mean charges for every single corner?
The distributor is the linear body of the
How many charges does the distributor have inside?
The work of telling it over the linear body
Who does linear charge distribution
and there is a linear charge distribution
Lada wacha is equal to q / one of the surface
if you guys have charged every single penny
If I give him an equal distributor then he will know
To do this you can use the surface charge density
do you apply the form q/a and if the volume
Inside you guys have divided the charges equally
If you give a distributor then you have to find out
So you guys can calculate the volume charge density
ho q / v after this move to next topic
It comes to be considered as equal or opposite type
You guys have put the charges at a center point o
If you separate them by a l l distance
AN ELECTRIC DAPOR IS CREATED
to measure its strength
Electric damper movement required
and what is it to charge into
Distance between both the charges that is 2l
And always remember that just like electric
Direction of field is positive to negative
There is an electric damper moment
Direction to you guys from negative to positive
The one who gets to see is Dapor, Dapor Man
This is how your dapor is
What is the electric field in the axial direction?
I want to know what is its equatorial position
If you want to find out if there is an electric field
For this, we solved the derivation
And this is what we found out from here, which is in Agile
The value of the electric field comes out to be
The value of dapor is 1/4 pa n 2p / x
to the power of 3 now look at x is r that depends
does that you have taken the line from the center point to p
what is the distance taken to reach the point so here
I have written r so it means this
no that is wrong and in the derivation we have used
If you do it then don't take tension in reality
The value is 1/4 Pa A0 p /
x to the power of 3 or r to the power of 3 then
The next topic that comes up is if
You guys are in a uniform electric field
Place a dapor at a random angle
If you did, then always remember that he is from Dapor
A first experience begins inside
If it happens from both sides then this is the reason
then start rotating that dapor
will give it is rotating meaning of physics
When torque starts getting produced in the language
If someone asks that in that Dapor
due to being placed in an electric field
how much torque is produced then it would be
is p over theta or I can say p over e
what thing depends on theta brother torque
It depends when the maximum and minimum are
You will have to tell me in the comment box and
Remember this thing, I will see you guys in 0°
We get the case of stable equilibrium and 180°
Unstable equilibrium is seen in
after this in the examination you people
Electric flux can be asked from
what happens suppose there is a surface
How many electric field lines are being linked
is that flux tells you guys so
The flux is always along the electric field lines and
It depends on the area and remember the dot
in the product because of this in theta form
You write this, it only means
From what has been read till now, this vector
Quantity, after this your next topic
comes its name is gauss law so what is gauss law
Works inside any close surface
Because of all the charges that are present
how much flux does it produce
Gauss law tells us how much
The flux produced q inside a n
So this much flux is produced now Gauss
There are three applications of the law. All three of Gauss's law
What is done in the application?
Different types of body are taken in that you
People calculate the value of electric field
ho with the help of Gauss law then Gauss law
In the application you guys basically get the most
First, wherever the flux is coming out from
Find out if he is a charge distributor
We have to find out both the flux and the charge
You have to put the value of into Gauss law
as soon as you put it in the equation
The electric field will go out first which
The application of Gauss's law is that
Multiple charges in a linear body
The distributor is inside its body
How much electric field is produced in it
what happens is l/2 pa n r memory
Keep this in mind, it depends on r, I mean
As the electric field moves away
the intensity will start decreasing on the surface
The charges are due to the distributor
How much electric field is produced
So that is sigma/2N remember this r
it is dependent after this the next thing that happens is
If the conducting body is a special sphere then
How do you place people in the sphere?
If the electric field is observed then
The electric field inside is zero
The electric field that comes from outside
it comes r s sigma / n r s its
Besides, always remember that this is our
It is a spherical body. If you look at it from a distance,
If you see it, you will feel that this is a
It looks like a point charge, meaning
Its electric field intensity is
It seems that because of this point charge it
We can also assume that its electric
Do you guys know the field of q/4 p n r
let's talk about the next chapter
Electrostatic Potential End
Remember the capacitance first
Electric is an extension of the chapter
I had completed this topic with flux and
a new topic starts
Electrostatic Potential Difference
in electrostatic potential difference
what is done is an electric field
In electric field if you are any one
Taking the charge from one point against the
The electrostatic field at any other point
If you take it then from where can I pick up the charge
and where they brought the charge
What difference in potential should be seen between
What is found is electrostatic
potential difference to potential difference
Whenever you take it out, take two respectable points
you can only take it out with help and what would that be
hay dail v wich is equal to work done a up 4
Now many times many people ask that
Finding the potential for a single point
When you show it, always remember to have a single point
It is not possible to extract the potential but
You guys can be clever, that's the second point
you guys take it to infinity and
If you pick it up from there and bring it, then the infinity
The pay potential is zero due to this reason
From reference to infinity you are single
How much potential is coming at the point
If you can find out then vchch is equal to w/
q happens after this remember one more thing
like you did a while ago
Electric fields were extracted specifically
Same for a point charge
what is electrostatic potential
For a point charge it is 1/4 Pa A0
q/r same to same as you said a while back
People used to generate electric field
you guys had to go to dapor on agile equatorial
for that you people are here
Agile is going to be the one to extract potential
Remember the value of equatorial Agil
The value that comes out is 1/4 Pa A0
p / x to the power of x to the power 2 equatorial pay
The value comes to zero at any point
If you want to subtract it, it is 1/4
pa a0 p / x ki pa 2 I am just saying x
Remember I have graduated from the center
The distance from p to its x is its
There are some small phenomena after that, remember them
is the relation between electric field and
Potential is sometimes needed del v chach
is equal to - e
dl2 is nothing else means distance
If yes then this is respectable for you people right
The specific relation must be remembered whenever you
Apart from this, people need to convert
Apart from this, the next topic also has a point
that is potential gradient what does it mean
that along with distance the potential
The value is always changing and at the same time
with potential difference potential
The formula for gradient is
Is -
dvdply.in that is p kath 2 - th th 1 meaning
where it was earlier, from where it was picked up from which angle
I will take it to you, that is the 2nd class you are doing
If yes, then the square is always in potential energy
If it gets converted then I have asked you many times
Potential energy can be stored on the dam
how much does it come when it is in an electric field
If it is placed then it comes to - p k theta I say
I can-
p.e. If you had brought it by lifting it on the brick at that time
But how much energy do you get? You get it.
what is equal 1 / 4 pa n q1 q2 / r s
Always remember energy is always off system
There will be two or more charges only
Next topic comes for higher charges
Capacitor is a type of capacitor
It is a device that stores energy within itself
Stores the electrical energy
Each capacitor in the form has its own
If there is a capacity then measure that capacity
use formula to find c which is
Remember the equation q / v is just a capacitor
It is going to come in your syllabus
parallel plate capacitor parallel plate
What is a capacitor? Take two parallel plates.
So in one you have positive charge density
I took both in the other negatively
If we take the distance between them as d then it becomes
Your parallel capacitor is gone, someone asked you
One may ask, what is the difference between a parallel plate capacitor and a
When there is no medium of any kind in between
means there was air in between so at that time
Method to check the value of capacitance
If she used to get it then she used to get it n a / d if someone
This means that between parallel plate capacitors
If dielectric material is taken into account then
Difference will be seen in capacitance
Obviously something will be seen and it will come
The value k n a / d is what happens many times na
Parallel plate capacitors have some distance in between
If the dielectric was brought into place
Numerical problems cannot be solved at that time
If you find it, there is a special formula for it
it happens it happens a / d - t + t / k
Or if we assume the capacitor to be
connect it in series in a proper way at that time
what will be the capacitance then remember that
The capacitance at time 1 is given by
/ c which is equal to 1 / c1 + 1 / c2
In addition to the number of capacitors you use, if you
People have connected capacitors in parallel form
If you have applied it then remember the parallel form
What is the value of capacitance in
whatever capacitance comes from c1 + c2
put the value of its capacitance PSC
told you that its not a derivation
its numerical will come what does it mean
How much energy is stored inside a capacitor
If yes, then she remains in the form of half poet
half q s / c in the form of half cv1
in the form which you will get in the examination
The values ​​given in the question are
Accordingly you can choose the formula and get the answer
Find out the next topic of yours
Remember the name is current electricity
Those of you inside chapter one chapter two
There were charges, those were on rest, now the charges
I started running whenever the charges came on time
When you run, current is produced and
Current is always q/t, always remember this
If you get electric shock from any conductor
If you run, you know that the electron
drift in the opposite end direction
If one starts doing it then the drift that occurs at that time
while doing this the velocity with which the electron travels
When we travel, that is called drift
velocity drift velocity you guys three
There is an electric scooter in different forms
In the field form it is l e e ta /
m is in the form of potential difference
ta /
ml8 is it you know in Holmes law you guys
you might have read it v chach is equal to aa hota hai
r What is resistance? Do you know it in childhood?
were that r f is equal to v / e but
Now that you've grown up, you've grown up
The form of resistance at this time is
If a larger form is seen then
You people face resistance
ml2 a If we write this in small form then r l /
a can also be written as the resistance
This is the form, remember it like I told you guys
explained a while back that the charges
There is movement happening here so I told him
If mobility is achieved then mobility is specific
what happens it is the ratio of drip
velocity to the electric field if here
If we put the values ​​then another expression will be created
The drip velocity is
what is equal to ta / m drip velocity and
There is a relation between mobility
Druff Velocity Meaning
If we talk about vd4 then you can know the current density
You can understand the current density denoted by j.
it is done and this is it is the ratio
of current upon area of ​​cross section current
There is another form of density which is
is in the form of sima e you must know that
Friend, we have different material
If you raise the temperature, if you are raising the temperature
which will be the initial resistance to temperature
There are changes in resistance when increasing
If it happens then how many changes does it bring
to find out a resistance
There is a formula which determines the final resistance
The value comes out whenever the temperature is increased
So that is the initial resistance bracket
in 1 ps alpha what is thermal cuff
or temperature efficient and here t which
There is changing in temperature many times
If only alpha is asked in the exam then
You have to carry this form with you,
Through this you can remove the temperature efficiently
You can always remember this when you increase the temperature
to sense resistivities inside conductors
The value of semiconductors increases
Any change inside the alloy occurs
There are three forms of electrical power
happens that happens w/ t i ba i s
If we put the values ​​of r and i then v is
You can also write power in the form of bar r
yes the topic for you guys is that emf now a
And remember one more thing, many people get confused
that between emf and potential difference
There is some different story in it isn't it
emf is the potential difference and
potential is emf next which is your
The important topic is the law of Gir Chafs
Kirchhoff's first law states that any
The current coming at the junction would be equal to
is equal to the current passing through that junction
or i can say sum of all current which is
The junction is coming which is always equal to
Kirchhoff's second law is zero, we
This is called the loop rule system in which
Davy's value is also the potential difference
This is equal to zero, this is very important
Apart from this, remember this in the examination
No, you guys have another topic that you should accept
This is your battery, now these are two batteries
there is a terminal this is a terminal that terminal now
These are two terminals, so between the two terminals
What is the value of potential difference in
then the terminal potential difference is
To understand what the value is you
People need to understand the concept of battery
The battery is either discharged or
so it is charging so when it is charging
The battery will be at that time when the value of v will be
That would be e p a and when it is discharging
So e-a is the last topic in this chapter
What happens is that wheat stone bridge in it
No specially such type of special
Arrangement of four registers is done
which happens in a way that you
The diagram shows the wheat stone buzz which
You guys study that balance in the syllabus
The condition means balance condition
that the resistance here upon here
The resistance should always be equal here.
the resistance of the resistance upon the resistance of the
Then we say that this is a balance condition
There are many questions asked in the examination of T Stone Bridge.
This is asked many times, you people should know
must remember the wheat stone bridge when balancing
If it remains in condition then on the middle portion
No current can see you running
means only current is received in this portion
after this the next one runs in
The topic comes up that is moving charges and
Remember magnetism first and second
Your story was different in the third chapter
Now if the charge was moving then current would be produced
I was doing it perpendicular to the current
Magnetic field produced in the direction
this is why the name of the chapter is that
A magnetic field is created due to the moving charge.
Magnetic field is now being produced
If the field is producing then it
If we have to determine then there are two types of laws
you get to see it happens first
Bio Sewt Law Bios Sewt Law K Through You
Finding the magnetic field of the elemental portion
You can have bias weight law
dp0 / 4p
idsa.in
It is written on the side that there are two inside the Bias Wade Law
The application is one of Ampere's Law
This is the application of BIOS SD Law which is the first
the application is what it says that a
There is a circular loop, how much is in its middle
Tell me if the magnetic field is running
It can be found out by 0i/2r one
And there is an application which says
that there is a circular ring with p points on it
Tell me how much is the magnetic field then
can be found out 0 n i s / 2a
s + x to the power of 3/2 and Apes law only
There is only one application in the examination
it is important that a very long
infighting is straight wire because of that
What type of magnetic field is formed then
That becomes 0i/2pir now you guys one thing
Do you understand that I am feeling a magnetic field, friend?
If there is some magnetic force also
So what would happen is that the magnetic force would
yes that happens q
Current is flowing in the direction d
If you are separated by distance then at this time you
Always remember people in the same direction
If current is flowing in two wires then one
Different attracts others
If current is flowing in both the directions
in the middle of the wire so they repel each other
If we do this, then the unit length on the floor
The value of is 0 i1 i2 /
is the attractive form for both the 2pd and
Next to both repulsive forms that your
The topic is Magnetic Dapor Moment.
Your m*2l is small here
I made a mistake, sign it and
Magnetic flux is the number of turns
So this will be another topic for you guys
that if you look at a current carrying coil
If you keep it in a magnetic field then it will always
Remember that the coil is the one that rotates
How much torque does it start producing
she does she does
mbson-sl remove proportionality constant
The constant of the galvanometer comes
which is called g, in this there are two concepts
people get to see there is one
Current sensitivity which is /i and second
There is voltage sensitivity which is called
/b Apart from this there is another in this chapter
The topic remaining for you people is artificial
Magnets which we call solenoids
what can be done by you guys one by one
Meaning you take a non-conducting base in it
People wound the wire in this manner
If current is passed then the magnetic field
If it starts running then it is an artificial
It starts working as a magnet
If yes then it is often asked that what is magnetic
How many field solenoids
Have to remember the topic of Toride from the syllabus
delete is the next chapter for you guys
Magnetism and matter are not specifically
Relies on natural magnets
You guys already know the topic of each chapter
It says if there are magnets outside
solenoids behave so from here it
I found out that yes it definitely does, why
it does because if we use magnet
Suppose this is a magnet, access to magnet
But if a magnetic field is removed then it
how much did it come / 4p to the power of 3 and when
We Are Solenoids
If we find the magnetic field at point p then
She also came so close that both of them were magnetic
The field came out as the same, from this it was understood that the bar
Magnets are truly equivalent
Solenoids
The magnetic field at the edge of the
How much is it on the equatorial then that much you
People get to see /4pm/x's
power 3 or power 3 of r same to same these are complete
The concept is same as chapter number one and
it's nothing if we don't have magnetic
Place a magnet in the field or
If you place the magnetic doper then it will
How much torque is produced is
mbson-sl susceptibility what is that
it is the ratio of i/h and susceptibility
The relation is relative permeability
with that happens u and what is equal to 1 + i a
Many times in the examinations numerical
It comes in the form, remember it in the exam
You should remember this form of magnetic induction
keep 0 h + i and intensity off
The magnetization is m/v magnetic
There is intensity v/s all these things to you
Apart from this, you should know in this chapter
You guys will get to see three types of material
Param magnets and diamagnets are available
Ferromagnets are such types of magnets
are materials that can be attracted to magnetic fields
In keeping him in the mirror they start repelling him
But if Paramguru is in a magnetic field
If kept, then the param magnetic material which is
Weekly attractions are directed towards the
If magnets and ferromagnetic materials are
If we keep it in a magnetic field then it
Strong Lee gets attracted towards the
There are two magnetic laws here: Curie's law and
Both Curie's and Wages' laws must be remembered.
please tell me the parameters on Curie's temperature
What does magnet get converted into? Comment
Answer in the box and then click on Next
There is a chapter, its name is EMI, EMI means
What does electromagnetic induction mean when
You too repeatedly refer to the magnetic field
If you make a change then it will cause an induced
emf and induced current produced
so if someone asks you whether it is induced
What is the current and induced emf then
Here it is, but before I understand it
I want to tell you that magnetic flux
There is also a thing called electric
If there is flux then there will be magnetic flux
is b theta I said changing in
An induced due to magnetic field
If DMF is being produced then that is Faraday
the second law of told you that this happens
Is ecc equal to t - d5 / dt8 how much
what happens happens to you guys - n / r d5
,
in dt3 magnetic field you guys have a
placed the conductor and you deliberately
You put a mechanical floor in it,
If you apply floor then how much is induced at that time
EMF will be produced, that is what happens here
B L V After this remember one more topic
You get to see people whose name
lens law lens law is basically no
because of the changing in magnetic field
Was current being produced or not induced?
Explain what is the direction of current
if it works then you people will remember it
When we read the detailed lectures
bringing one coil close to the other
If it were there then direction in the current would be visible
If you were there, do you guys remember what the lens law is?
It was said that when the coil came close to the other coil
If she was there then she would not let him come close to her and
When I went away from him, she wouldn't let me go
Meaning he opposes the change and then gives two
The topic is very important for you people, that is
Induction: Before understanding induction, understand
Let us see what an inductor is. So, an inductor is
There is a type of device that
Energy in the form of magnetic field inside
and stores two types of
Self-observation of phenomena is possible
Self inductance and mutual inductance
What is inductance? Let's understand the value
Look, current is flowing through it, current is flowing through it
What will happen inside this changing in magnetic
What is field changing in magnetic field?
will produce induced EMF then remember
Keeping the induced emf in self induction
does that current which produces it
What does it mean that it is a type of EMF
which is opposing the current, this is the reason
That emf from the back is called back emf and back
The emf can be calculated as - l d a
dt2 inductance such that the mutual inductance
denoted by a capital m is that
is n2 52 / i1 then basically they are mutual
Remember what inductance is
Due to the current in the first coil, the second
Flux is produced inside the coil
What you guys get to see happening is
is mutual inductance then self inductance
You can also use solenoids
as well as the mutual inductance you
Solenoids
She comes respectfully, she comes with this
Later in this chapter you will get another topic
can be seen whose name is
alternating generator alternating generator
There is a type of generator that
By producing mechanical force you
People get to see that too
Basically in the form of alternating current
What happens in this that makes you people magnetic
You have to take the field and here you people
An armature has to be taken and this armature
These are connected to the slip ring and
The slip ring is connected to the brushes and
The brushes are connected to a wire which
Go and ultimately a bulb is connected here
But you guys put a handle on it intentionally
so that the magnetic field
There is a coil inside that rotates over and over again
Let it continue to happen and remember this whenever
again and again inside the magnetic field here
If you try to change it then a current
If it is produced then the current production would be
that is the form of alternating current
In the alternating generator something like this
behaves like an alternating current
The principal is the EMI only, after which whatever
The next chapter is called
Alternating Current Alternating Current and
There is a huge difference in direct current
Alternating Current, What is Direct Current?
It runs directly from one side only
Talking about current, this is alternating current
runs anytime, anywhere so
The current in your house too
Alternating current runs alternating
The current changes its direction all the time
who lives with respect to time
You guys write simple current let's say 5
Ampere is in the form of alternating current
You guys can see it in the form of 5s omega t
If you write it clearly then remember it
Alternating current is written in this form
goes i0s omega t i n means maximum
Current and voltage are written as v0
oga t v0 means maximum voltage always remember
keep the current and see it runs in full cycle
ok so the average for full cycle
What will be the value of current if it becomes zero
Comes along with it for half cycle
What is the value of average current?
comes 65 maximum current apart from this next
The topic is Root Mean Square Value
with Current Root Mean Square Value
Current can be seen from the flux in your house
and different devices have their own
Acquire according to maximum current
So the root mean square value of the current
it happens it has value
ir2 having the same root mean square value
There is also voltage and it is yours
It is important to remember the v0 / √2 formula
After this whatever the next topic is, you guys will
What comes down to this is what you guys will do
You will need three different devices
you will connect it to alternating voltage and
You guys will provide a V voltage like V0
oga t and check how much current is flowing
it is there and through that you will find out that
Is there any value of face or not?
or facer difference what is face or facer
Difference between voltage and current in actual
works to explain the relationship between
if we supply a
In the register you guys are looking for v0 of omega
You will provide the voltage and the current
I get to see what I get i0s oga
t so I can say the voltage is as much as
Provide the same amount of current that you got, this means
It is neither current forward nor voltage backward
Both of them walking together to see you guys
are getting but in inductor such
There is no story when you see the inductor
If you connect to alternating source then
the voltage you provide is v0 sa omega
t and the current you get is what you get
i0s oga t - of pa / 2 i can say -
of pa/2 face i can say that
The current in comparison to the voltage
running behind and also in the phasor diagram
you guys will denote the current backwards if I
If the capacitor provides voltage
I am from Let's so how much current do you want to see
will get that i0s omega t + 5/2 and pa
/ Tell me what the actual 2nd phase is
that in comparison to the voltage
The current flowing inside the capacitor is Pa
A major one among the three from Bat Phase
there's a thing like the resistance here
The resistance in the resistor is called
r denotes the inductor which
There is resistance, its name is
reactance and its value is x and
One is called omega A and in capacitor
The resistance which occurs is also called reactance
This is called the tens of capacitor and it
denotes its value by AXI
is 1/omega if we consider inductor capacitor
Connect all three resistors
from the alternating source then the whole system
is called an LCR circuit in which the total
The value of resistance is given by √ r s +
- vc1 so it is very important to remember these forms
The next topic after this is important
Resonance comes out from this
You guys will get to see the related
Resonance is a condition where
The value of impedance becomes low and the current
When the value of starts running towards maximum then
In Resonance you guys who are Resonant Eng
The frequency that is observed is
1 / √ is the AC and resonance frequency is
That is 1/2p√ac and there is another one
Remembering things is a formula q
What is the actual sharpness factor?
I explain about resonance and it happens
omega a/r or else if we consider the capacitor
If it is made in the form then it would be 1 / omega s r
If yes then you should remember both these forms
It is very important to always remember the latter
The topic is average in alternating circuit
What is the value of power then average power
The value of p comes to average watch is equal to
It is called the transformer ratio
Inside the transformer you guys are on one side
I will see the input coil on the other side
If you see the output coil in the
Keep the transformer too much
It is important and on whose principle is it
It works by mutual induction
if it works in phenomenon then i hope you
These things became clear to the people till here
After this, whatever next chapter you guys will see
its name is EM wave EM wave is a
There is a type of wave inside which
You can see electromagnetic waves
what are you trying to say electric
Wave of field Wave of magnetic field
Propagators together in one direction
increases as it increases let's say y
Direction electric field running
The magnetic field is running in z and
Ultimate Wave to you guys in the x axis
This wave is always seen while running
You guys are running in the positive axis
will always be seen and with the em wave
You can see the direction in the form of e cross b
People have been explained about the electric field
The nature which is there is a transverse nature
is the electric field accelerated charge
from particle or osit charged particle
If there is an em wave then the wave's
If equations are being formed then there will be two types of waves
The equation of an electric field will be
and if there is a magnetic field then it will be electric
The wave equation of the field becomes e na sa k k
in the form of x-omega t magnetic field
will become b0s k one - omega t asked many times
what is the frequency of e wave
So remember v/v switch is equal to 1/2 pa
√ This is the value in examination
It is asked what is the velocity of e
Waves in space so remember the light
But the formula is equal to velocity
If you write it in the form of then write it in this way
You can do 1 / √ M A0 and for any medium
If we want to find out 1/√m then this question is asked many times
hey what is the momentum of e wave so remember
p chach is equal u/c apart from all these
remember in exam
The electromagnetic spectrum is very
It is very important in the examination
You people are asked about their frequency
and you should remember the wavelength to tell me
There should be no need for radio waves
Microwave Infrared Visible
ultraviolet x-ray gamma all of these
Frequency wavelength must be remembered and these
Everyone should remember their applications very well
Guy who gives exam is more important
is asked in like radio wave
it is used for communication purpose
Is microwave cooking or heating food?
this is something that is used in radar systems
You guys have infrared in your mobile etc.
You guys get to see hot bodies
This is produced during night vision
Do you know if visible light is useful?
It is true, if you are seeing it with your eyes then you would know
Yes, what is the use of Ultra?
If we talk about violet light then germs
Ozonizer is used to kill water
It is useful if you sit for a long time
Tanning happens, X-rays remain
Used to specifically diagnose
and is used to make photographic films
Gamma ray is what it is specifically
For research on radioactive elements
and medical diagnosis
It is also useful for all these purposes
If you have any other important thing apart from
If you know anything then tell me Lasik Eye Surgery
A very famous name in today's time
Which EM is getting cosmetic surgery?
It depends on the wave, comment box for me
Let me tell you guys what your next chapter is.
Its name is Ray Optics so remember that Ray
Give optics, you guys are divided in this
one reflection and one refracted reflection
Always remember to have optical in the portion
center which is equal to r/2 you guys
and the mirrors formula which is visible
whatever happens it belongs to you people 1 / v + 1 /
u chch e i 1 / f is very important
And here the mag is released - off v / u
There is a law of reflection which says that
The angle aa is equal to the angle r
But when you read refract, the angle is
You will never see an angle equal to r
Meets and explains the Law of Reflection
what is snells law i eq
sins.com So in its form you will get a complete
You have to solve the derivation from there
Standard Formula of Refractory Nickel
comes t / v - of u1 / u chch is equal to
mu2 - mu1 / r u1 external refractive
The refractive index of this index
Clear Guy then next topic is
Apparent depth and real dip for a glass
Take water in it and put the coin in it
Where the water level is at the actual distance
so that's called real dupe but what
This is what happens when you look from above
Looks like the coin has come upside down
It is said that the image of that coin, so that image
At what depth it is visible it is called
There is apparent depth, apparent depth and real
There is a formula for depth, it is
my church is equal to real depth upon apparent
Depth or Apparent Depth which is equal to
Real depth upon refractive index is very
It is very important in the examination
If asked, you should remember this after that
Nor would you people get to see another topic
that is the critical angle the critical angle is a
This is the type of angle, what type of angle
it happens just leave it, first understand the thing
Look here you guys can see the angle and from here
the angle will be refracted r you have done one
took such an angle, took such an incident angle that
If the value of r is 90°, it means that in which the value of r
The value should be 90° for that type of angle of
The incidence is called the critical angle then
Light travels on a surface at a critical angle
and if you people are critical
If you take an angle larger than the angle then
At that time the light bounces back
and because of bounce back TIR
Total internal reflection starts happening
and is based on total internal reflection
The optical fiber that runs through your home via WiFi cable
You must have felt that there was a TIR inside it
People get to see the speed of light
I send you signals from one place to another
If the place comes in the phenomenon of TIR then
I think it is clear about all this
Besides, let's assume a class slab is Light
I would have fallen from here, if this wasn't there
The light would have gone straight but what happened to the glass lab
Because of this a light band happened and then another one
If there is a bar band then I can say that
Actually the light was going straight like this
But the shifting has happened so much, so what is the end
How much lateral shift happened here
Displacement that has occurred can be detected
By this formula it is t
sin-1 / r After all this, remember this
You may be asked in the examination
Lens phenomena: There are two types of lenses
are concave so whenever you
If you are making it then how do you use it
What do I want to do manufacturing and what do I want to do
He should know what kind of focal length it should have
To do this the lens maker used the formula
Let's say there is a lens, because of this
Here the race went from the object in this manner
If there is no side surface then the race
I could have walked straight but there was a surface on the side so
Traveled from another surface and then band
I can say that the first surface
for the object was o the image was and the other
who was the object for the surface that
Who was coming towards him and who was the image?
i so because of this a lens maker formula
it becomes 1 up f which is equal
1 / r1 - 1 / r2 in t u -1 is the same as
You guys can extend another formula
You can remove it, its name is thin lens
This is the mirror formula for you guys
Mirror formula will be seen for siblings
there is a plus here in this here
There is a minus as in the mirror formula
You guys also got to see a magnification
Such linear magnification lens was available
happens + of v / u and same to same number of times
It may be asked what is the power of the lens
If it happens then that is the recipe of
Focal length Apart from all this, I will tell you guys
assume two or more
Lenssex this lens this way and ask
Tell me what will be their total focal length
So that will be 1 / f which is equal to 1 / f1 + 1 /
f2 so remember apart from all this you
People can be asked the topic of Prism
Light in a prism, this is how you guys saw it
the light bent and then went here
The angle of incidence is formed here
Make it off emergency by extending it here
An angle is formed which is called minimum
deviation then you may be asked that the angle
of prism and value of minimum deviation
what happens to these two deviations
There are formulas that you guys should remember
and the angle of prism is
r1 + r2 can be asked multiple times
what is the value of refractive index
comes inside the prism so what is here
The value of angles i and r comes out to be
You can create a formula by putting them together
he comes
sin2 up in sin2 so these things up to here
It is clear, after this optical is for you people
Instruments are seen the most
The first is a simple microscope
A microscope is basically a convex lens
and there is nothing else in it
The magnification that can be seen is this
There are basically two types of microscope in a compound microscope.
of the manner
In the lensation microscope you can see it here
An objective towards the pay or object
lens which is small and fits snugly on the eye
There is an eye piece or lens on the side
which is larger than any one object
Race first hits this then a small image
She makes it and then magnifies it a little.
By doing this you will see a distinct vision
lets say that
What is the final value of magnification
If it comes then there it is this n u n * d / u n
Magnification I can say m0*m as well
I can say that means magnification of
Objective lens and magnification of the eye
What is the maximum magnification of this piece
If it comes out, it is for you people
So much for you in respectable form
It is seen that this is very important
he comes in the examination and is normal
adjustment or can I say minimum you
The magnification that people see
He gets so many v0/u*d/f times
It may be asked that what is a compound microscope
what is the total length from here to here
till then it is v0 + u after that
Astronomically the telescope comes out
In this you guys see the objective lens is bigger
remains because of the distance of the object
It is very big and the eyepiece is small
Rays will come from far away and reach here first
Here you people will get convergence which
The image came and then by enlarging it a little
The eyepiece shows you a lovely image
Remember, telescopes do not magnify the image
He brings me closer on time
The magnification comes out and it is f0
/ u maximum magnification is this much and
Its minimum magnification is this much
Apart from you guys reflecting type
This is such a type of telescope
Guy has a telescope in which there is only and only
The mirror used is of Cassegrain type
It is called telescope so here you people
A concave concave mirror is seen
The rays will come from far away from the concave mirror here
The secondary mirror will collide here convex
which bands the rage here and I
Shows it in pieces and makes it more convenient
To make this, Newton Bhaiya used Newtonin
They took out the telescope, what should they do here?
use a concave mirror and place a
Do not use convex mirror, use plain mirror
Use it, the race will come straight from the plane mirror
It will collide and go here and from here the IP
You guys will see it, remember it is cheap
It is easy to use and is less expensive
Remember in wave optics, light wave
travels in form here you will find
We will meet Haag Bhaiya, this is what Haag Bhaiya said
that light is in mechanical wave form
travels wherever the wave goes
If there is light spread then they have not done it
Through the law of reflection and the law of refraction
Through Heiger's Principles both of these can be
If we prove it then both these derivations become
I want a lot in the examination
There is an important derivation apart from this
The topic is super position, assume two
The waves are super imposing on each other
so this is super position principal what was this
Sum both the waves and find the value
After this the next topic comes
Your interference is an interference
There is a topic which tells that when two waves
are super imposed on each other then either
It will either create big waves or small ones
When big waves are formed, it is called
There are constructive interferences when they are small
It will become a wave causing destructive interference
It is said and this was discovered by the Young Double
from an experiment called Slit that will
It is not in the syllabus now but its
If you can get the expressions then they will give you
If you want to know then remember the path
The value of the difference that you people calculate
she comes she comes
[music]
ydd424
Fringe vid both of them have whatever comes, it's a fight/
d and the resultant intensity that comes out is four
Times of intensity come and
The minimum that comes in the resultant is zero
Besides this, remember one more thing
The value of bright fringe in the interference
That is the dark fringe in diffraction
If the value of is then in the interference
The value of a dark fringe is that
The value of bright fringe in diffraction
The graphs of these two are always remembered
keep the intensity in it always equal
will get it whether the fringe is bright or dark
Why fringes or central maxima
If we understand diffraction then diffraction is a
There is such a type of phenomenon in which you people
keep bending the light imagine how this
assume light from a surface
From here you will feel the light quality area
I will go but it does not happen
The band becomes a little lighter, then it is of two types
you get to see diffraction
Fresnel diffraction occurs, the second is
Basically in Frons offer Fresnel diffraction
A single slit will be taken light here
It will come this way and then it will bend here
This Frasal Diffraction of yours will work
But Fraunhofer diffraction is a different type
What is it with this you guys don't even have a lens in the middle
You use the direct ray that was coming from this
There will be a bend and you will be at a respectful point
The same derivation will give you the value of the logo
Young Double Spread with Log Interference
As the experiment becomes visible
Here also the value of part difference
The value of phase difference is same
which is seen in interference
You only get the value of bright fringe
The dark fringe has the opposite value and
Nothing in the center which is maximum bright
You guys understand the value of fringe
This is the reason why it is seen the most
You guys are at Intensity Central the most
There is age compared to other places
Remember this in Young Double St Experiment
This type of graph can be seen all
The intensity is the same at different places and
Intensity in Diffraction at Central
it starts more and then slowly decreases
The next topic starts to become dual nature
In the case of radiation and matter radiation
You can learn more about the photoelectric effect
Understanding that there are such types of phenomena whenever
High Energy High Frequency Low Wave Length
of light falls from a metallic surface
Then the electrons start getting liberated from it
and this whole phenomenon is called
The photoelectric effect at the time when
The electrons are getting liberated it is called
If the light of low energy is photo electron
If we fall here, will the electron
will go out, will not go out at all
to allow the electron to escape
The minimum amount of energy needed to
it is called work function so work function
Always provides you with more energy than
then the electrons can come out
and even after coming out the energy that
I need him to run, he is kinetic
The energy that Einstein Bhaiya gave to you people
He explained it to me saying that the energy you
What you are providing should be equal
Meaning of work function plus kinetic energy
The amount of energy it provides
The electron has a minimum amount of energy
to get out and use the remaining energy
Always remember that I started running away with you
The photoelectric effect can be explained in such a way that
It can be understood as soon as you make the light fall
c In a photo sensitive plate we observe
let's liberate the electron from here
starts happening and from the meter plate
The collectors start going towards the plate
Computer is used here which is connected to the current
Remember the exam changes the direction
Micrometer is asked many times in Hindi
It is used because there are photos here
Sensitive plate of very minimum amount
Apart from all this, current always flows
Remember if you make this plate positive
go ahead and get the light fall done to maximum
The electrons will go and get attached to it
A time will come when the current value will be
it will increase, it will increase, but after that
it will get saturated because after that
All the electrons are in one plate
After reaching there there is nothing left
to move from this plate to this side if this plate
If it is made negative then the light falls from here
make the electrons go here and
The electrons will start rotating back due to this reason
will it happen that the potential starts dropping
The potential will start retiring
And at that time, what we call potential
what is that called stopping
potential followed by some important
These are the graphs which you will see in the examination
Kinetic Versus should be remembered
Graph of frequency v max vs v of
Graph of Saturation vs Intensity
of Stopping Potential Versus Frequency
Graph Potential vs Current which is explained below
I and here is the one with returning potential
You will need to remember the graphs very well in the exam.
Apart from this, broccoli is also important
The hypothesis is very important
Many times you are asked in the examination
How did they solve the second batch of Borse
I understand that he was saying that the electron is
Simple Aisa Around the Nucleus
The electron itself does not move in a circular motion
What is matter and matter also has waves
If nature exists then it is due to wave nature
Electrons don't normally run like this
The electron will go in wave form
I want to see you guys running like this
so from here de Broglie bhaiya
with the help of second potchle boards
Explain things and then go to the next topic
comes atom and nucleus then atom and
The chapter on atoms in Nucleya
We had the first discovery in this
Alpha Particle About Nucleus
What was done here in the experiment
The alpha particle source was bombed
I went to the gold file and alpha was on 99
The particle went straight but at 4 off alpha
This explains why particle deviations occurred
There appeared a tiny spot in the center of the atom
Who is holding the nucleus which is at 99
mass is near it and whenever alpha
If the particle collides with it then it moves here and there
deviation and it has mass of 999 on this
In the experiment it was understood that 8000
Out of the alpha particles, only one is alpha
The particle was a deviation of 1
one of the million alpha particles that are
The particle was just 180 degree angle
that he had gone back now he is finally scattering
what is angle then that is what you
People can remember this formula alpha
between the particle and the nucleus
it seemed that this was it besides this next
The topic is close approach which means that
How close to the nucleus does alpha pass?
The particle that went to the head is the closest
distance r of approach and its formula
This happens and the next one is the impact
Consider this parameter as your nucleus
and the alpha particle is coming from here and
this is the center line so from the center line
The velocity of the nucleus in the middle of the vector
The distance is called impact
You guys have to remember the parameter formula
Where it came from and what it came from doesn't matter
Remember the formula, it is important
Rutherford had made some mistakes
Brother Bordes had corrected Rutherford
This was to say that the electrons which are attached to the nucleus
He roams around in the
goes from the nucleus, apart from this these
It is said that we create a continuous spectrum
you guys get to see it happen
electrons are not discrete so borse's
This meant that all the electrons have their own
revolve in orbit and whenever
If the electrons revolved then at that time
Does not liberate any type of energy
which brother Rutherford was saying that while roaming around
He does it on time, only then he goes
So Bors gave his three postures
In which all these things were explained by a book of Borse.
there are five which are very important
One must remember in the exam that every
If the electron revolves around the nucleus
If you want to revolve then do it only on one condition
What can revolve is Angular
Momentum is the integral multiple of
h/2 is required then only electrons revolve
can do all these around the nucleus
In addition, we found out that the electrons
and the nucleus is in between them,
radius is the kinetic energy of the electron
What potential energy is it moving with
with what velocity is it moving then those
You should remember all the formulas
All the formulas are very important
The formula for the radius of the bore is just this
You guys have to keep the value of z as one
If this formula is made then all three formulas
It is very important to remember
and what is the frequency of the electron
So I will give you guys another special formula
Besides all this I have given you to remember
How much energy can be seen in an electron?
If we get this much kinetic energy then we can see that
gets this much potential energy
gets total energy to see this much
We get all the constants from all these
put the value of values ​​the value of z
If you do one put then you people will get a standard
The energy value of hydrogen atom is nickel
she comes - 13.6 on n s
Electron volts are very important
Apart from all this, you guys have energy level
Whenever you see R electron ground
If you go from a state to an exciting state
Will absorb energy whenever exciting
If it comes from state to ground state then
If it will liberate energy then always remember that
If anyone from an exciting state
If the electron is coming to the ground state then
It is called the Lemon Series and at that time
you guys getting a burst of ultraviolet radiation
It is seen whenever the electron is higher
From Exciting State to First Exciting
If it comes in the state then that series will be won by Bagmar
At that time you people are called series
The region of visible light is seen when
also light higher excited state than seconds
When the end comes in exciting state then the question
The series is called Infrared Viewing
will be obtained whenever n from the higher exciting state
Key value four means third exciting state
I want you guys to see the electrons coming
then it is called bracket series
And whenever the electron gets higher excited
will come from the state to the fourth exciting state
So that is called the P fund series and all these
I respect you guys for the wavelength
value comes in this respectable form
I have to remember them very much
After this, the nuclear chapter is important
If we enter then there will be nuclear chapter
In 1989 we discovered that the nucleus
There is only positive charge inside
There is no other neutral charge
present is positive charge which is
You guys are equal to the mass of the positive charge
gets to see the one whose name is
Neutron is asked many times in examinations
What is the atomic mass unit taken to be
If it happens, you should remember
What is the size of a nuclear
is r f e equals r0 a to the power 1/3 and
It is asked many times in exams
what is the density of a nuclear
is 3m / 4p r0 to the power of 3
is a constant term is a constant term
Tell me in the comment box how much is the value
After this a topic comes out which
The name is mass defect. What is mass defect?
basically there is a mass defect
If we call the calculated mass as observed mass
If you get it minused then you people will have mass defect
It turns out that mass defect explains this
From this neutron proton it becomes a nucleus
When we weigh both of them
If we try, we will find out
that the constituent neutron is the sum of the protons
The weight is more as compared to them
from the nucleus, here the energy is
Where did the loss occur? It happened in mass defect
So always remember neutrons and protons
When the nucleus is formed by combining the
So at that time there seems to be a binding energy
It seems like our Einstein equation
In the form e chch is equal to del ac of
What is Square and Dell AC? Dell is here
a what is the mass defector mass here
If the value of the defect is put then in this way
The formula for binding energy became
Apart from this you guys have to see two topics
Nuclear fission and fusion fission will be available
What happens in a heavy nucleus and two daughters?
breaks down into nuclei such that
uranium which when hit with a neutron
If done, it will break down into barium and krypton
will get three neutrons and heavy
amount of energy will be obtained and this chain
It creates a reaction and in today's time
You guys can see the atomic bomb being made on this
we will get to see what happens next
Nuclear fusion what happens in it
Daughter nuclei combine to form a hevius
and release neutrons and heavy
The amount of energy released means
Fusion produces more energy than fusion
And this is for you guys to see inside the sun
I get this equation and I have to keep it last
Your topic is semiconductor like this
Type of device whose conductivity
resistivities are conductors and
You guys can see the energy in the middle of the insulator
If you read about band gap, there is one
The valence band is the conduction band
Electrons always sit in the valence band
live and if current is to be passed then
jumping the electron from the valence band
If it is necessary to go into the conduction band
Valence band and conduction for insulators
The energy gap between the bands is very large
it lasts so much that
The electron cannot go into this even if it wants to
Because of this there is no current flow in it
Valence band Conduction band inside a conductor
those that remain overlap
So the electrons can easily move from here to there.
we find that current can flow
There is no sufficient quantity inside the semiconductor
there is an energy gap of amount but as soon as
If you provide energy, the valence band
the electrons move into the conduction band
and the current is there to see you guys running
who gets it that's why it's called room
Behaves like an insulator in temperature
and if you increase the temperature then it acts like a conductor
how a semiconductor behaves when you
If you study semiconductors then you will know
Two types of semiconductors will be seen
Intrinsic and Extensive Semiconductors
There are two forms of p type semiconductors
n type semiconductor n type semiconductor
The value of number of electrons inside is more
is in comparison to hole and P type
The number of holes inside a semiconductor
The value is more as compared to
of electrons and which is in pure form
Semiconductor is present in it both
The value remains exactly equal whenever you p
Type Semiconductor and n Type Semiconductor
If you connect these then a junction is formed when
also if you connect them then in the middle there is a
A depletion layer is formed which is a type of
this acts as a barrier and here there is a
A potential barrier develops, which is a
do not allow the electrons to move from one place to another
because of which you people get this one
It can also be seen working as a regulator
Whenever the legion layer remains thin
The faster the current will flow in that condition
It is said that forward bias whenever depletion
The layer will remain thick and the electrons and holes will move
won't be able to defuse
drifting will not be possible due to which the current
Slowly will not be able to run very fast
The condition that will run is called reverse by
sing to forward by sing in p side
from the positive end and the N side to the negative end
You have to connect to it only then it is possible
finds the p side of the reverse bias sing
from the negative end and the N side to the positive end
you have to connect to it then only it
Reverse wisping is its only
This is an application which you can use in the examination
The one that is going to be seen is the half wave
Full Wave Rectifier Half Wave Rectifier
I provide you guys with alternating current
you do it and you guys do it in this method of half wave
you get to see the wave form from it, which means you
People should provide alternative sources
But you guys can see half waves here.
Why do we get this because whenever the current comes from this side
If he runs then because of the forward vice one
A wave will be formed when he runs from this side and then he will be blocked
It will be done, if you run from here then it will be done again
then it will be blocked but when you guys are full
If you use wave rectifier then at that time
You guys use two diodes here.
I can say that if you use PN diode then when
Whenever the current flows like this, then forward in one
will happen in one there will be reverse and when such
If it runs then one is in forward and one is in reverse
Because of this you guys get continuous full waves
It is very easy to see this being made
It was more important, I hope to you guys
I hope you guys have understood things
This video was posted shortly before the examination
If you are watching then best of luck to everyone
Don't worry, subscribe to the channel
Because this channel is after your boards
It is also going to be useful because
After boards you guys have to give CBT
I will start my exams from first of April
I'm going to start it for you guys
CU's 30 days special for Physics
My courses which you can join
